## Version 4.1.1

* Added option to store POPM profiles and configuration files in your user's AppData Roaming folder instead of Documents folder. Hopefully, this solved the issue where OneDrive users are having issue with POPM files.

* Fixed POPM inability to close correctly when Keyboard Shortcuts preference is disabled.

* Fixed issue where auto start option failed to retain CommandLine arguments in exe.xml file.

* Fixed issue where auto start does not work correctly for Steam version of MSFS since exe.xml file location has been moved by Steam installation.

* Added ability for full screen panel to work as floating panel. An example use case is to show and hide EFB as full screen using keyboard shortcut.

* Added dynamic LOD (my own implementation of AutoFPS) - this is totally experimental and unsupported. If you decide to use this version of dynamic LOD, you don't have to run multiple apps.

* Fixed various smaller bugs.
